## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Project Description
GAME- THREE CARD MONTE (memory game).
- A very popular street card game which tests the memory of the player. There are three cards set up which includes the Ace of spades ,
the player is shown the card, then the card is shuffled. the Player must now follows the card to choose the right one. 



## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP 

- Add user auth

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

### Landing Page

### Game Initialization

### Playing The Game 

### Winning The Game

### Resetting The Game

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
